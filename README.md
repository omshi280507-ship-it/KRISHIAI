## 🚀 Problem & Solution

*The Problem:* Kerala’s 7.5 million farming households, who contribute nearly 10% to the state's GSDP, face significant challenges. Fragmented landholdings (avg. 0.18 ha) and annual crop losses of 15–25% due to preventable pests and climate events limit their income and potential. Crucially, there is no single, farmer-friendly platform that unifies critical information on weather, market prices, and government schemes.

*Our Mission:* To empower every farmer with timely, data-driven, and localized intelligence that improves yield, boosts income, and promotes sustainable agricultural practices.

*The Solution:* KrishiAI is a bilingual (English/Malayalam), mobile-first AI assistant that provides a unified dashboard for all farming needs. It delivers personalized, actionable insights by integrating various APIs and AI models, all presented in a simple, accessible interface.
